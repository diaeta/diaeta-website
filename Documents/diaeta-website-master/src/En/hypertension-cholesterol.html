                <h2>Hypertension and Cholesterol: The Silent Threats to Your Heart</h2>
                <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) and hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) are two of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes. Often asymptomatic, they can insidiously damage your arteries and heart over time.</p>
                <p>High blood pressure corresponds to excessive pressure of blood in your arteries, forcing your heart to work harder. Excess cholesterol, particularly LDL cholesterol (often called "bad" cholesterol), can build up on artery walls (atherosclerosis), narrowing them and restricting blood flow.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, changes in your lifestyle, and particularly in your diet, can have a significant impact on managing these conditions.</p>

                    <h4>The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Approach</h4>
                    <p>The DASH diet is specifically designed to reduce hypertension. It emphasizes a high intake of:</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled text-start mt-2 small">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Fruits and vegetables (rich in potassium, magnesium)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Whole grains (source of fiber)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Low-fat dairy products</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Portfolio Diet</h4>
                    <p>This approach primarily aims to reduce LDL cholesterol by combining a "portfolio" of foods with recognized effects:</p>
                     <ul class="list-unstyled text-start mt-2 small">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-primary me-2"></i>Soluble fibers (oats, barley, psyllium, eggplant, okra)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-primary me-2"></i>Plant sterols and stanols (found in enriched margarines, some yogurts)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-primary me-2"></i>Soy proteins (tofu, soy milk, edamame)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-primary me-2"></i>Almonds and other nuts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="small mt-2">The combined effect of these foods can rival that of some cholesterol-lowering medications.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text-center lead mb-5 mt-4 animate-on-scroll fade-up delay-100" style="max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto;">
            It is important to note that while the DASH and Portfolio approaches provide scientifically validated frameworks, Diaeta does not simply apply a one-size-fits-all model. We adapt and personalize the principles of these diets according to your unique health profile, dietary preferences, and lifestyle to create a strategy that is truly sustainable and effective for you.
