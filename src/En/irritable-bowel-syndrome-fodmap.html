                <h2>What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?</h2>
                <p>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional digestive disorder. This means that, although there is no visible organic disease (like inflammation or a lesion), the functioning of the intestine is disturbed. IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or an alternation of both).</p>
                <p>It is a common condition, affecting approximately 7 to 15% of the world's population, with a predominance in women and a diagnosis often made before the age of 50. Although not serious, IBS can significantly impact quality of life.</p>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Common Symptoms of IBS</h3>
                <ul class="list-styled">
                    <li>Lower abdominal pain, often related to defecation.</li>

                    <li>Bloating and a sensation of abdominal swelling.</li>

                <ul class="list-styled-dots">
                    <li>Altered gastrointestinal motility.</li>
                    <li>Visceral hypersensitivity (an increased perception of pain in the intestine).</li>
                    <li>Disturbances in the brain-gut axis (the communication between the brain and the digestive system).</li>
                    <li>Low-grade inflammation in the intestinal lining.</li>
                    <li>Changes in the gut microbiota (the intestinal flora).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on defined symptomatic criteria (like the Rome IV criteria) once other digestive conditions (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases) have been ruled out. A medical consultation is essential to make an official diagnosis and to exclude any concerning symptoms that would warrant further investigation. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, studying nutritional factors, such as FODMAPs, is a preferred pathway to regain control of your condition and significantly improve your quality of life.</p>

            FODMAPs are a group of short-chain carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the small intestine. In sensitive individuals, particularly those with IBS, they can trigger unpleasant digestive symptoms.

                <h3 class="h4 text-center">How do FODMAPs cause symptoms?</h3>
                <p>Due to their small size and poor absorption, FODMAPs exert two main effects in the intestine:</p>
                <ol class="list-styled-numbered">
                    <li><strong>Osmotic Effect:</strong> They draw water into the small intestine and colon, which can lead to loose stools or a sensation of distension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> As they are not completely absorbed, they arrive intact in the large intestine where they are rapidly fermented by gut bacteria. This fermentation process produces gas (hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In people with IBS, who often have increased visceral sensitivity, this increase in fluid and gas in the intestine can cause distension of the intestinal wall, stimulating the nerves and triggering symptoms such as pain, bloating, flatulence, and changes in bowel habits. Although this mechanism may seem complex, it is the key to understanding how a targeted dietary strategy, such as the Low FODMAP approach guided by an expert dietitian, can offer significant relief and help you find digestive comfort again.</p>

            The low FODMAP diet is a structured dietary approach, developed by Monash University, aimed at identifying specific food triggers for IBS and significantly improving symptoms. It is not a lifelong diet, but a learning tool that Diaeta helps you master with expertise and support, so it becomes a personalized and livable solution.

                    <h4>Phase 1: FODMAP Restriction</h4>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 4 weeks</strong>.<br>
                    During this phase, all high-FODMAP foods (identified by a red or orange light in the Monash FODMAP app) are temporarily replaced with low-FODMAP alternatives (green light). The goal is to significantly reduce digestive symptoms to establish a baseline.</p>

                    <h4>Phase 2: FODMAP Reintroduction</h4>
                    <p><strong>Duration: 11 weeks</strong>.<br>
                    Once symptoms have improved, this phase involves methodically reintroducing each FODMAP group, one by one, to identify which ones are problematic and to determine personal tolerance thresholds. This is generally done by testing a representative food from each FODMAP subgroup over several days, while maintaining a baseline low-FODMAP diet.</p>

                    <h4>Phase 3: Long-Term Personalization</h4>
                    <p><strong>Lifelong, with periodic re-evaluation</strong>.<br>
                    Based on the learnings from phase 2, a personalized and expanded diet is established. This involves reintroducing all well-tolerated FODMAPs and limiting only those that trigger symptoms, and only in problematic quantities. The goal is to have the most varied and least restrictive diet possible while maintaining good digestive comfort. FODMAP tolerance can change over time, so it is advisable to periodically re-test poorly tolerated FODMAPs.</p>
