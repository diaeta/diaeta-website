                            <li>Less common types like LADA, MODY, and Type 3c require specialized diagnosis and management strategies.</li>
                            <li>Prediabetes is a critical warning sign that presents an opportunity to make proactive changes that can delay or even prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes.</li>

                        <h2>Why Your Diabetes Type Matters</h2>
                        <p>Diabetes is not a single, one-size-fits-all condition. It's a spectrum of different types, each with a unique root cause that affects how your body produces or uses insulin—the key hormone for turning food into energy. This core difference explains why management strategies can vary so much from person to person. Understanding the specifics of your diagnosis is the foundational first step to a truly personalized and effective care strategy, allowing us to clarify the "why" behind your body's glucose patterns and build a path forward with confidence.</p>

                    <section id="t1d">
                        <h2>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)</h2>
                        <p>Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Without insulin to help glucose enter the cells, blood sugar rises quickly. This makes lifelong insulin therapy essential to prevent dangerously high blood sugar levels and manage the condition effectively.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="t2d">
                        <h2>Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)</h2>
                        <p>Representing over 90% of diabetes cases, Type 2 is a metabolic condition characterized by insulin resistance (where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin) and a relative lack of insulin. It is often linked to genetics, body weight, and lifestyle factors. T2D is progressive, but many individuals can manage it successfully with a personalized diet, increased physical activity, and, if needed, oral medications or insulin.</p>

                    <section id="lada">
                        <h2>Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)</h2>
                        <p>LADA is a slower-onset form of autoimmune diabetes that appears in adulthood and is often misdiagnosed as Type 2. It involves a gradual destruction of insulin-producing cells. Initially, oral medications might be effective, but as insulin production declines over time, insulin therapy will likely become necessary. Proactive and adaptive planning is key to managing LADA.</p>

                    <section id="mody">
                        <h2>Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)</h2>
                        <p>MODY is a rare, genetic form of diabetes caused by a mutation in a single gene, and it typically runs strongly in families. It often develops before the age of 25. Unlike Type 1, some subtypes of MODY may not require insulin and can be managed effectively with oral medications. A proper diagnosis through genetic testing is crucial to ensure the correct treatment approach is taken.</p>

                    <section id="gdm">
                        <h2>Gestational Diabetes (GDM)</h2>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes is diagnosed during pregnancy and is caused by hormonal changes that interfere with insulin's effectiveness. High blood sugar during pregnancy can affect the baby’s growth and the mother's health. While it usually resolves after delivery, GDM increases the future risk of developing Type 2 diabetes for both the mother and child, making postpartum follow-up important.</p>

                    <section id="type3c">
                        <h2>Pancreatogenic (Type 3c) Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>This form of diabetes results from damage to the pancreas, which can be caused by conditions like pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or pancreatic surgery. In Type 3c, the pancreas often fails not only to produce enough insulin but also to produce necessary digestive enzymes. This makes management more complex, often requiring both insulin and enzyme replacement therapy.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="prediabetes">
                        <h2>Prediabetes: A Critical Warning Sign</h2>
                        <p>Prediabetes is diagnosed when blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes (e.g., Fasting Glucose 100–125 mg/dL, or an HbA1c of 5.7–6.4%). It serves as a crucial warning sign. Without intervention, many people with prediabetes will progress to Type 2 diabetes. However, it's also a critical opportunity to act. Timely lifestyle changes can effectively prevent or delay its progression.</p>
