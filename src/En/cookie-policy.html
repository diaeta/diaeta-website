            <h2>II. The Categories of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <p>When you visit our site, we ask for your consent to use non-essential cookies. You can manage your preferences at any time via our cookie management module. Here are the categories of cookies we use:</p>
            <dl class="mb-4">
                <dt>Strictly Necessary Cookies</dt>
                <dd class="mb-2">These cookies are essential for the proper functioning of the website and cannot be disabled in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions you take that amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling out forms. You can configure your browser to block or alert you to the use of these cookies, but some parts of the site may then not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information and do not require your prior consent.</dd>

                <dt>Analytical (or Performance) Cookies</dt>
                <dd class="mb-2">These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources in order to measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and to see how visitors navigate the site. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. A typical example is Google Analytics. Your explicit consent is required.</dd>

                <dt>Marketing (or Targeting) Cookies</dt>
                <dd class="mb-2">These cookies may be set through our website by our advertising partners (e.g., Meta (Facebook), TikTok, LinkedIn). They may be used by these companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other websites. They do not store personal information directly but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. Your explicit consent is required.</dd>
