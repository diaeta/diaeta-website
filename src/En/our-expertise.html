                <p>My journey into nutrition is driven by a passion for science and a deep desire to provide solutions that truly work. My background, combining a <strong class="text-highlight-primary">Bachelor's in Dietetics from Erasmus University College</strong> with an earlier degree as a <strong class="text-highlight-secondary">Computer Programmer and Analyst</strong>, gives me a unique perspective. I apply scientific rigor and analytical thinking to solve your nutritional challenges, leveraging technology to enhance your care.</p>

My own experience with type 2 diabetes also gives me a profound, personal understanding of the challenges and triumphs of managing a metabolic condition.</p>
                <p>I am a proud member of the <strong class="text-highlight-primary">UPDLF (Professional Union of French-Speaking Dietitians)</strong>, a mark of my commitment to the highest professional standards.</p>
