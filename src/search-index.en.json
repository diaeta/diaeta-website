    "content": "Managing type 2 diabetes on a daily basis can seem like a major challenge, often associated with restrictive diets and frustration. At Diaeta, we are convinced that it is possible to regain control of your blood sugar while continuing to enjoy tasty and satisfying food. Here are 5 key tips, based on our scientific and personalized approach, to help you on this journey. ## 1. Understand the Impact of Carbohydrates, Without Demonizing Them It is essential to understand how carbohydrates affect your blood sugar, but that doesn't mean eliminating them completely! The important thing is to choose the **right types of carbohydrates** and manage the **portions**. * **Favor complex and fiber-rich carbohydrates**: Sourdough whole-wheat breads, quinoa, oats, legumes, vegetables. They are digested more slowly, avoiding blood sugar spikes. * **Limit added sugars and refined carbohydrates**: Sodas, candies, pastries, white bread. * **Learn to read labels**: To identify hidden sources of sugar. At Diaeta, we teach you how to integrate carbohydrates intelligently to maintain your energy and enjoyment of eating. ## 2. The Crucial Importance of Dietary Fiber Fiber is your ally! It slows down the absorption of glucose, improves insulin sensitivity, and promotes satiety. * **Aim for at least 25-30g of fiber per day**. * **Excellent sources**: Vegetables (broccoli, spinach, Brussels sprouts), fruits (berries, apples with the skin on), legumes (lentils, chickpeas), nuts, and seeds. * **Incorporate them gradually**: To avoid digestive discomfort. ## 3. Don't Be Afraid of Good Fats Healthy fats are beneficial for cardiovascular health (often an issue with diabetes) and can help with satiety. * **Choose unsaturated fats**: Extra virgin olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds (flax, chia, sunflower), fatty fish (salmon, mackerel). * **Limit saturated fats** (fatty meats, butter, whole dairy products) and **avoid trans fats** (present in some processed foods). ## 4. Regular Physical Activity: An Es"

The Diaeta Method is a structured and proven approach, designed to adapt to you and guarantee concrete, definitive results, without ever sacrificing the pleasure of eating. Discover the Pillars of the Method Why a Method Rather Than a Simple \"Diet\"? The human body and nutrition are complex. \"One-size-fits-all\" solutions or restrictive diets ignore your unique biology and lifestyle, often leading to frustration and long-term failure. You need a strategy, not just a list of forbidden foods. The Diaeta Method was designed to overcome these obstacles. It systematically integrates: A deep understanding of your metabolism, whereas standard diets offer generic solutions that are often ineffective because they are not adapted to your uniqueness. Solid and recent scientific evidence, unlike trendy diets that are often based on unverified claims and can prove ineffective in the long run. Advanced personalization to your needs and tastes, ensuring a food plan that you will find tasty and motivating, far from 'one-size-fits-all' approaches that ignore your preferences and lead to frustration. Modern tools, including our mobile app, for precise tracking of your progress and direct communication with your dietitian, offering a responsiveness and support that traditional approaches struggle to match. Warm and expert human guidance from your dedicated dietitian, essential for guiding, motivating, and personalizing your journey, whereas many diets are limited to a simple, impersonal roadmap. "

Diaeta guides you with personalized, science-based nutritional plans to protect your future. I'm Taking Care of My Heart {# === Understanding Section === #} Hypertension and Cholesterol: The Silent Risks to Your Heart High blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) are two of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes. Often without symptoms, they can silently damage your arteries and heart over time. High blood pressure means the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high, forcing your heart to work harder. Excess cholesterol, particularly LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, can build up on artery walls (a process called atherosclerosis), narrowing them and restricting blood flow. Fortunately, lifestyle changes, especially in your diet, can have a significant impact on managing these conditions. {# === Evidence-Based Approaches Section === #} Proven Nutritional Strategies: DASH and Portfolio Diets Scientific research has identified several effective dietary approaches for improving blood pressure and lipid profiles. At Diaeta, we use these solid foundations to build your personalized plan. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet The DASH diet is specifically designed to lower high blood pressure. It emphasizes a high intake of: Fruits and vegetables (rich in potassium, magnesium) Whole grains (for fiber) Low-fat dairy products Lean proteins (poultry, fish)"

Although we share the majority of our genetic code, subtle differences (polymorphisms) explain why we do not all react in the same way to nutrients, foods, or certain diets. These genetic variations can impact: Your metabolism of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and therefore your relative needs for weight management or performance. Your specific needs for certain vitamins and minerals (e.g., efficiency of vitamin A conversion, needs for folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D). Your sensitivity to dietary compounds like caffeine, lactose, or gluten. Predispositions related to weight management (e.g., perception of the taste of fats, tendency to snack) and cardiovascular health (e.g., response to sodium, types of fats). Thanks to nutrigenetic tests, we analyze more than 70 genetic markers to obtain valuable information, allowing us to refine your nutritional plan "

A targeted and personalized nutritional approach, guided by Diaeta, is the key to managing your blood sugar, preventing complications, and living life to the fullest. My Diabetes Journey Starts Here {# === Understanding Type 2 Diabetes Section === #} Understanding Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, meaning a level of sugar (glucose) that is too high in the blood. This situation occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body's cells become resistant to insulin's action (insulin resistance). Over time, uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to serious complications, affecting the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and the cardiovascular system. That's why proactive management is essential. Risk Factors and the Role of Lifestyle Several factors can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, including: Being overweight or obese (especially excess abdominal fat). A sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity. An unbalanced diet, high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats. A family history of diabetes. Age (the risk increases with age). Certain ethnic origins. The good news is that many factors, particularly those related to lifestyle and diet, are modifiable. {# === Nutritional Management Section === #} Nutrition: The Cornerstone"

Body composition analysis.\" lang: en --- Specialized Service Sustainable Weight Loss: Your Personalized & Scientific Journey Tired of restrictive diets that leave you hungry and frustrated? At Diaeta, we understand that sustainable weight loss is not achieved through deprivation. Our scientific and personalized method guides you towards your goals by teaching you to eat with pleasure, without ever feeling hungry. My Transformation Starts Here Understanding Weight: It's More Than Just a Number The number on the scale is just an overall and often misleading measure. Your body composition—the ratio of muscle mass, fat mass, water, and bone mass—is a far more relevant indicator of your metabolic health and real progress. At Diaeta, we use bioelectrical impedance analysis to get a precise picture of your body composition. This data allows us to track the changes in your fat and muscle mass independently and to tailor your nutritional strategy for targeted results. This detailed approach is key to creating a truly personalized plan that aims for effective fat loss while preserving your precious muscle mass and maintaining optimal hydration, ensuring lasting results far from generic, calorie-counting approaches. Why Traditional Diets Often Fail Do you feel like you're fighting against your own body? You're not alone. Here’s why standard approaches are often destined to fail: Generic Approaches Ignoring your unique metabolism, preferences, and lifestyle inevitably leads to an unsuitable and unsustainable plan. That's why Diaeta is committed to a deep analysis of your individuality to co-create a strategy that truly works for you. Restriction & Frustration Constant d"
